## **Project Description**

The **Race Strategy Optimizer** is a web application that predicts the **optimal tire compound** (`soft`, `medium`, `hard`, `wet` or `intermidiate`) based on a combination of race parameters. It leverages a neural network classification model trained on a synthetic dataset to simulate real-world Formula 1 decision-making.  

The application includes:

-  Real-time tire prediction based on multiple dynamic inputs.
-  A custom-trained neural network built from scratch.
-  A live FastAPI backend.
-  Docker containerization for seamless deployment.
-  Load testing via **Locust** to evaluate performance under stress.

# Explanation 
These images above showcase the results of the Flood Request Simulation using Locust to evaluate the API's performance under load.

# Locust Test Report (Locust_logs.png)
  - Provides detailed request statistics, including the total number of requests, response time, and failure rate.
  - Confirms that all requests to /predict and /retrain endpoints were successful with zero failures.
  - Highlights response time metrics, showcasing latency at different percentiles.

# Performance Charts (Locust_charts.png)
  - Total Requests per Second: Shows API request throughput over time.
  - Response Times (ms): Displays how response times evolved, with percentile-based analysis.
  - Number of Users: Visualizes the number of concurrent users simulated during testing.

These results validate the robustness and scalability of the deployed API under simulated load conditions.
