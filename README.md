## **Project Description**

The **Race Strategy Optimizer** is a web application that predicts the **optimal tire compound** (`soft`, `medium`, `hard`, `wet` or `intermidiate`) based on a combination of race parameters. It leverages a neural network classification model trained on a synthetic dataset to simulate real-world Formula 1 decision-making.

# Featuers
---
1. **Tire Prediction**  
   - Users can input values into the model, and the system predicts the optimal tire selection for that instance using a pre-trained machine learning model.
   - The input the user inputs will be saved into a database for later retraining.

2. **Model Retraining**  
   - Users can click the fetch data button so it fetches data from the database, and then click the retrain trigger so I can use new data to retrain the model. This ensures the model adapts to new data and remains accurate.

3. **Data Visualizations**  
   - A dedicated page displays various interactive visualizations based on the dataset, with key insights and interpretations.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Detailed metrics for retraining processes are displayed.

6. **Performance Testing**  
   - A **flood request simulation** was conducted using **Locust software** to evaluate system performance under heavy load.

The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, while the backend is developed with **FastAPI**. The machine learning pipeline was designed from scratch, including scaling and monitoring on a cloud platform.

# Explanation 
These images above showcase the results of the Flood Request Simulation using Locust to evaluate the API's performance under load.

# Locust Test Report (Locust_logs.png)
  - Provides detailed request statistics, including the total number of requests, response time, and failure rate.
  - Confirms that all requests to /predict and /retrain endpoints were successful with zero failures.
  - Highlights response time metrics, showcasing latency at different percentiles.

# Performance Charts (Locust_charts.png)
  - Total Requests per Second: Shows API request throughput over time.
  - Response Times (ms): Displays how response times evolved, with percentile-based analysis.
  - Number of Users: Visualizes the number of concurrent users simulated during testing.

These results validate the robustness and scalability of the deployed API under simulated load conditions.
